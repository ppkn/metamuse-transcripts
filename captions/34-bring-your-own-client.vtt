00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>Rather than giving someone this hermetically sealed box, can we use an analogy,</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:07.680
like build a beautiful Lego set for them and hand it to them where if they like

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.680
it just as this that's fine. And if they want to add one Lego right there,

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.580
it's not a big deal.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.130
They sort of see the composition of how this thing was made.

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.100
They have a little bit of flexibility to tweak it because it's made out of

7
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:18.210
parts. They understand.

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.490
<v 3>Hello and welcome to Metamuse. Muse is a tool for thought on iPad.</v>

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.210
This podcast isn't about Muse the product, it's about Muse the company,

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.410
and the small team behind it.

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.710
I'm Adam Wiggins here with my colleague Mark McGranaghan.`.

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.251
<v 2>Hey Adam.</v>

13
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.740
<v 3>And joined by Geoffrey Litt.</v>

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350
<v 0>Hello hello. It's good to be here. So Geoffrey,</v>

15
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:47.450
one thing I'm thinking about these days in raising my young child is growing up

16
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.500
in a multilingual household since both of her parents are from two different

17
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:53.060
countries and we're living in a third country.

18
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.660
I know you grew up in a multi-lingual household as an adult.

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.840
What are your reflections on that experience? Yeah,

20
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.750
so my mom's Japanese and I grew up sort of half my childhood in the US half in

21
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.700
Japan. And when I was a kid,

22
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:08.300
my mom sort of forced me and my brother to learn Japanese when we were in the

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.160
US. And I was just thinking about how I'm so grateful now that she's sort of

24
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.420
overrode our preferences as children and that now I have some proficiency in the

25
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:19.760
language. And so raising kids is complicated.

26
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420
<v 3>There is going to be, I can see this already at this young age.</v>

27
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:27.080
And I think that it gets only more so as children get more agency naturally with

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.260
age, which is parents do know better,

29
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.020
they're just older and wiser and know how the world works.

30
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.580
And at the same time, a kid needs to find their own way.

31
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.930
And authoritarian upbringing doesn't sound particularly like a good way to

32
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.010
blossom as a person.

33
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.990
So finding that balance between what's prescribed by parents "you'll thank me

34
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.090
when you're older" in this case, literally so,

35
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.590
versus "let a kid find their own path." I think that's an ongoing,

36
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.930
philosophical, moral dilemma.

37
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.920
<v 0>Yeah. Especially for something as difficult as learning a language. You know,</v>

38
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.670
I do think with whether it's sports or music or these skills that take a lot of

39
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.504
time to master,

40
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
I've also been grateful that my parents helped me learn to love

41
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.160
Japanese and building some of that motivation,

42
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.250
whether that's from visits to Japan, to hang out there as a kid,

43
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.550
I tend to believe that the goal of education at a young age,

44
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:22.490
isn't primarily to transfer the skill it's to, as they say,

45
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.640
light that fire that eventually keeps learning, going into this day.

46
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.370
I'm practicing my Japanese, trying to keep it up.

47
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.320
And so I think that's an important balance to strike too.

48
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.330
<v 3>What's that saying,</v>

49
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.260
if you want to set sail on a boat, you're building,

50
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.830
you don't teach someone to build a boat. You teach them to yearn for the ocean.

51
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.410
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. I think there's a lot of that at play.</v>

52
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.640
<v 3>So Geoffrey I'd been wanting to get you on the podcast for a while here.</v>

53
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:50.750
We got the chance to work together on the Cambria project at Ink &amp; Switch last

54
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:54.050
year, but I'd love to hear just a little bit about your background,

55
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.770
how you came to be doing this work in the tools for thought and independent

56
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:58.604
research space.

57
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 0>Yeah. So I'm currently doing a PhD at MIT in Computer Science.</v>

58
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.690
I'm in a lab called the Software Design Group led by my advisor, Daniel Jackson.

59
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.030
And at the highest level,

60
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.530
the questions I'm trying to explore are how do we empower more people to kind of

61
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:16.600
take full advantage of the medium of computing?

62
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.190
I think it's very ironic that we've invented this infinitely flexible thing

63
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:22.024
called software.

64
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.990
And most of the way that we use it ends up being a small group of people,

65
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.810
make some stuff and throw it over a wall and everyone else uses it.

66
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.190
And I'm just interested in new approaches to building software that change that

67
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:37.210
dynamic. But before coming into this academic side of things,

68
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.950
a lot of my thinking on this area actually came from working in

69
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.430
startups, in shipping real software to people. If you'd asked me five years ago,

70
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.360
are you going to be doing a PhD? I would have laughed at you and said, you know,

71
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.720
no, I'm not that kind of academically minded person,

72
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.690
but over my time in startups, I got really interested in these topics.

73
00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.100
And I decided that rather than go try to start a company or something,

74
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.900
the academic environment offers a certain amount of freedom from the need to

75
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.070
ship real software immediately,

76
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.820
The need to make money immediately that I thought would be really valuable for

77
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.870
kind of thinking more deeply about what the problem actually is here.

78
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.670
And maybe bigger picture ways to reorient the way that we build software.

79
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.650
<v 3>Yeah, that makes sense. You have both industry background, as they might say,</v>

80
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.060
ship stuff, fast,

81
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.770
solve real customer problems and kind of academic mindset,

82
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:32.940
longer time horizons, more of a search for basic truths,

83
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.480
trying to think bigger and more expansively and more philosophically.

84
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.321
And that's actually,

85
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:40.890
I think a place that Ink &amp; Switch kind of excels or a part of its reason for

86
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:44.940
existence is to kind of be in that middle space between those two worlds,

87
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:49.800
which I think is not well occupied. And certainly for creative tools. Generally,

88
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.450
I feel like that at least right now is the space where we need the most

89
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.100
minds and the most effort.

90
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.211
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:57.211 --> 00:05:01.020
That's part of why I have really enjoyed following Ink &amp; Switch's work over the

92
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:05.190
years and I've gotten to collaborate a bit with the lab and I think it fills

93
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:09.840
this really important middle place between those two worlds.

94
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:15.090
Too often I think startups are kind of not reflecting on the larger

95
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.230
possibilities of what they could be doing if they had more than three months

96
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.890
they had to think about. And on the other side you have academics too.

97
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:27.810
I think sometimes it's not really clear to me how idea transfer really happens

98
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.650
from academic human computer interaction research to the real world.

99
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.560
Sometimes I don't think it's a smooth process where, you know,

100
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.130
startups are devouring papers that are being written and trying to implement

101
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:41.040
them in the real world. I think it's a much messier process.

102
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.020
If you look at even someone like Doug Engelbart,

103
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.410
who I think is a hero for a lot of people in this community,

104
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.230
it was really hard for him to get his ideas out into the world,

105
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.950
ultimately succeeded, but through a pretty circuitous path.

106
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.610
So I think it's really valuable to have institutions that are thinking about

107
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.640
both of those worlds simultaneously with the ultimate goal of actually deploying

108
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.440
in some form their ideas,

109
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.890
as opposed to just sort of just handling the ideas half of things.

110
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.250
<v 3>Yeah. Well,</v>

111
00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:12.150
that's why I think I really enjoy following your work so much that you do fit in

112
00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:16.410
that middle space and hopefully it can be a role model for the rest of us on

113
00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:16.411
that.

114
00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:18.380
<v 0>Yeah. I'm trying to, it's tricky.</v>

115
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.770
There are a lot of tensions to navigate as I'm sure that you guys have

116
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.693
experienced.

117
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.110
<v 3>And also thank you for being one of the very early users of Muse during the</v>

118
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.810
beta, as well as, uh, customer, uh,

119
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.110
hope you'll consider renewing your subscription. When that comes up again,

120
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:36.080
you've both tweeted lots of screenshots about how you use it,

121
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.600
which is I think really great for other people,

122
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:43.130
seeing how you use things and the Every publication even wrote an article kind

123
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:44.330
of detailing your work.

124
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.610
And you talked about a lot of different tools in your flow,

125
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.690
include some screenshots of Muse there. So very much appreciate your business,

126
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.010
but probably even more than that,

127
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.640
the kind of very public moral support makes a big difference.

128
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.700
Especially in the early days of a product. When you know,

129
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.530
you don't have so many believers just yet.

130
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.720
<v 0>Yeah, thanks for building such a great tool. I mean,</v>

131
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.120
I bought the big iPad pro originally when I was starting to dip my toes into the

132
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:12.920
academic waters and being confronted with a lot of 8.5x11 PDFs and

133
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:14.750
decided I wanted a nicer way to read them,

134
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.740
but something felt like it was missing there in terms of synthesizing across

135
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.260
them. And when Muse appeared, I was like, this is it.

136
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.900
This is maybe the early versions weren't the perfect product yet,

137
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.720
but I could tell the vision was exactly what I needed.

138
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:28.250
And so it's been a blast using it.

139
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.240
<v 3>So our topic today is bring your own client,</v>

140
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.950
which is something you've written about.

141
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:37.010
And of course I'll link that article in our show notes here,

142
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:41.480
but maybe you can tee up for the listeners a little bit, what that's all about.

143
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.131
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

144
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:47.780
So bring your own client means having the flexibility to

145
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.100
pick what application you want to use when you're working with some data and for

146
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.240
there to be some independence,

147
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.950
especially I think between people who are collaborating on the same project to

148
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.200
pick the software that they want to bring to the table.

149
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.980
So I think like to give a concrete example, right back in the old days,

150
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:07.640
when we used to email each other files to work on a document,

151
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.920
let's say I could email you a word doc,

152
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.420
and then you might open that word doc in apple pages or open office,

153
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.760
whatever your preferred word processor is.

154
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.040
And then you would send that doc back to me and I don't care what application

155
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:25.640
you used on your end, as long as I get a file back, we can work together. Right?

156
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.350
And in fact, if we're emailing files,

157
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:29.240
I also don't care what email client you're using.

158
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.620
There's sort of this inherent point of flexibility built in where we get to make

159
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:38.270
these individual choices about how we want to work and broadly the topic I've

160
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:41.660
been thinking a lot about these days is how I think that we are starting to lose

161
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.960
some of that flexibility with the way that computing is headed.

162
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.670
So I'm very interested in this overall ethos of bringing our own clients and

163
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:53.420
perhaps even building or customizing our own clients, um,

164
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.310
to gain a little more control over our experience with software.

165
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.380
<v 3>I think email is one of the best examples perhaps because it's this really one</v>

166
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.810
of the oldest standards in some ways,

167
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:07.290
sort of the first internet protocol in some ways,

168
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.420
and the plethora of different clients that have existed over time. I dunno,

169
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.980
I used Pine and later Mutt,

170
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.260
this kind of terminal based clients at university in the 1990s and

171
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.400
going forward to Gmail was this big revelation in terms of lots of great

172
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.090
interface innovations, as well as backend innovations,

173
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.770
but it could just work right away.

174
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.270
You didn't need the person on the other end to be also a Gmail user.

175
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.850
They could be with any email client.

176
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.101
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

177
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:41.150
And I think email is one of those domains that really demonstrates how valuable

178
00:09:41.151 --> 00:09:42.800
it can be to have this flexibility. You know,

179
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:46.010
I think sometimes it can be tempting to say, does this really matter?

180
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.640
What's the big deal. It can't, we just all agree on the same software to use.

181
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.480
But if you look at something like email, I know a lot of people, some of them,

182
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.260
not that technical who have really strong opinions about what email client they

183
00:09:57.261 --> 00:10:00.080
want to use, because they've just found one that works well for them.

184
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.980
I've had many moments of my favorite email clients sort of going out of business

185
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:07.550
or being acquired and hopping from one to the next and searching for that

186
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:10.220
elusive best client. And I think for anyone,

187
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.210
who's sort of in email for like eight hours a day at their job,

188
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.070
you start to see why having this degree of flexibility genuinely matters for

189
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:22.340
people. And it's not just like a little convenience, it's actually a big deal.

190
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.450
<v 3>Right and so you see this not only in the big example of Gmail,</v>

191
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:29.990
that really revolutionized a lot of things about how email works,

192
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.830
but even nowadays we have a plethora of new clients, Superhuman,

193
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.220
Tempo is another cool up and coming one, or for example,

194
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.650
on the Muse team for our inbound support,

195
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.850
where you can just basically email hello@museapp.com that goes into a product

196
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:46.670
called Front. And so this is kind of a group inbox,

197
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.330
email thing that has quite different characteristics from what an individual

198
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:54.110
might want, but it's nice because the person on the other end, they don't care,

199
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.540
what we're using, they can just send us an email.

200
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.160
Maybe they include attachments.

201
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.280
Maybe they include whatever we reply back within that.

202
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.200
So that gives each party in this back and forth can use what suits them.

203
00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:09.410
And what's going to suit a team that's going through a bunch of support requests

204
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:11.960
is just dramatically different from what might suit an individual,

205
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:13.370
doing their own personal inbox.

206
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.664
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

207
00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:18.590
I actually personally use Tempo and I think it's a great example of a niche

208
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:21.410
product. It's really perfect for what I'm looking for.

209
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:23.480
They have a really minimalist design.

210
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.690
They have this concept of batching your emails, so you don't get distracted.

211
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.800
And for me as someone who's at least trying to not check my email a hundred

212
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:33.200
times a day, it sort of aligned with what I want.

213
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.610
I don't think it's necessarily the perfect product for everyone or even the

214
00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:39.320
majority of people. But I think it's right for me,

215
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.530
it's just great that because we have this sharp protocol,

216
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.880
I can make that choice to adopt this niche product that maybe only 1% of email

217
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.800
users will ever use without convincing all this other 99% to join me

218
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.970
in using this thing. We started take this for granted with email,

219
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:59.290
but look at Slack. There's not really a concept of a third party slack client,

220
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.180
right? And I think it's easy to forget how monolithic that experience is,

221
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.960
every team that uses Slack is stuck with the exact same user interface,

222
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:12.220
with no ability for individuals or even teams to really meaningfully customize

223
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:12.910
it.

224
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.930
And I think that's a tremendous design challenge to try to make something that

225
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.020
works well for so many different people and so many different workflows.

226
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.530
<v 3>Yeah. Maybe there you illustrate the trade-off though Slack because it is an</v>

227
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:29.820
integrated product where they control every part of it, the client, the API,

228
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:31.470
the data storage, all of it.

229
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.940
They can work on a very integrated and sleek experience.

230
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.250
Twitter went through something similar in their early days.

231
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:42.630
They were moving in this direction of being a platform there was this initial

232
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.620
explosion of clients that tried interesting things like TweetDeck and Tweetie

233
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:47.454
and so on.

234
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.090
And ultimately they decided it was a product decision within their company.

235
00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:53.970
We don't want to be a platform. We don't want to be the next email.

236
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.010
We want to provide a end-to-end curated experience

237
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.380
where when we were going to add a new feature,

238
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:06.090
whether it's images and video inline or something else that we can

239
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:09.960
fully control what that looks like for all the parties in the equation.

240
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.100
And that's the trade-off that I think you always have to make and email is a

241
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:14.934
good example.

242
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.410
You do get weird stuff that happens when you email between two clients and they

243
00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:22.740
don't quite agree about how to display the results.

244
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:24.840
And also it's very difficult to add new things.

245
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.580
I say this speaking as someone who'd really like to embed video into email

246
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:32.640
newsletters, and you just can't do it. You've got to use animated gifs,

247
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:36.000
which are low quality and slow to download and so on,

248
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.730
but it's just not a standard that can quickly evolve.

249
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.040
<v 0>Yeah, I think this is indeed one of the core tensions in this idea.</v>

250
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.050
How do we balance moving fast with a single decision being made about an

251
00:13:48.051 --> 00:13:50.630
ecosystem versus having this more distributed approach?

252
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.490
One idea that I find interesting though,

253
00:13:52.491 --> 00:13:55.190
is kind of this idea of partial compatibility.

254
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.470
Can we find sort of middle points between these extremes of a single rigid

255
00:14:00.471 --> 00:14:05.450
standard that hasn't evolved since the eighties versus a company that just

256
00:14:05.451 --> 00:14:07.520
decides whatever it wants and imposes it on everyone.

257
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.320
I think we can potentially at least try to have app ecosystems where you might

258
00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:15.560
have two applications that share 80% of their functionality.

259
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.040
And there might be parts around the edges that don't work perfectly together,

260
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.800
but that might be something you can manage as a team,

261
00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:24.800
especially if you're working with people and you know, what tools they're using,

262
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.060
I'm really interested in finding tools and sort of platform approaches to

263
00:14:29.061 --> 00:14:32.990
mediate this kind of fuzzier partial interoperability.

264
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.470
<v 2>Yeah. I think there's a really interesting spectrum here,</v>

265
00:14:36.471 --> 00:14:39.170
or maybe even a whole world of different possibilities.

266
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:40.250
I'm reminded for example,

267
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.260
of this idea of aftermarket support that you see in consumer durable

268
00:14:45.261 --> 00:14:47.570
goods, like cameras for example,

269
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.050
and there through fiat or evolution,

270
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.370
you have some standards. Some connection points where people can plug in often,

271
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:58.820
literally, and you might have the core be proprietary,

272
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:02.630
but there's all these extensions and accessories that you can put on it.

273
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:07.010
And because of that, you get an enormous ecosystem of tools.

274
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:08.330
And so on that you can build around the core,

275
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.750
like a good example of this would be tractor attachments where there's the

276
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.470
three-point hitch and you can basically put whatever you want on a tractor,

277
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:17.780
you know, a plow, a snowblower, whatever.

278
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.970
And that's really interesting because you enable profitable commercial entities

279
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:26.450
and there's only a few of them to build the extremely complex integrated

280
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:27.260
tractor.

281
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.350
And then you have this whole world of mom and pop metal fabrication shops,

282
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:33.710
building random implements for 200 bucks. It's really interesting balance.

283
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.510
And I don't see that very often in software.

284
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:35.894
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

285
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:40.550
I think it's also interesting in software to look at domains where you often

286
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:42.980
have a lot of tools that look pretty similar to each other,

287
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.850
if you squint take to do list software or like team issue, tracker software,

288
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:50.390
for example, every time I see a landing page for a new project management tool,

289
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.210
there's a lot of concepts there that look pretty familiar.

290
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.310
You have things to do. You assign them to people,

291
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:56.690
you have some notion of projects.

292
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.680
And yet every tool has a little bit of some unique spin on that problem.

293
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.370
There's perhaps new ideas that they bring for organizing stuff.

294
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.840
And yet I think it's reasonable to say that maybe 80% of the core ideas are

295
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:09.650
shared.

296
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.010
So something we actually worked on on the Cambia project that I worked on at Ink

297
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.670
&amp; Switch last summer was, let's say as one example,

298
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.410
you have one to-do list app.

299
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:22.100
That's decided that you can assign something to multiple people to work together

300
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:26.210
on. And another app says that a to do is assigned to a single person.

301
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.860
And what if you want those apps to inter-operate you might just say this is

302
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.020
impossible, but you could also say, well,

303
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:34.430
if you assign something to multiple people,

304
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.010
we'll just show the first one on the other app that only allows a single

305
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.844
assignee.

306
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.940
And maybe that's good enough for your use case to get by with that sort of

307
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.970
partial a little bit of bridging between those ideas.

308
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.230
And I think if we can get creative about bridging between similar but not

309
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:48.951
identical apps,

310
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:53.030
more that opens up a lot more possibilities for how we can have tools work

311
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:53.864
better together.

312
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.011
<v 2>Yeah, exactly.</v>

313
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:58.880
Another thing that I'm reminded of here is the metadata that you can put at the

314
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:00.710
top of HTML pages. I'm actually forgetting the name.

315
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:02.660
What's the right name for this. The.

316
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:02.660
<v 0>Meta-tags?</v>

317
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.090
<v 2>The meta-tags I guess. Yeah.</v>

318
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.340
And there's a whole world of emergent, somewhat adopted,

319
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.140
partially adopted somewhat conflicting standards for preview cards and Twitter

320
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:19.430
preview cards and open network preview cards. And, but it kind of works out,

321
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:22.220
right, because there's this basic platform entry point,

322
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:26.120
which is the meta-tags and then different platforms and users adopt different

323
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.100
subsets of them. But in practice it tends to work pretty well.

324
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.700
<v 3>Yeah. I think the web,</v>

325
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.230
obviously in many ways is a great example of an open and evolving standard that

326
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:39.120
on one hand has innovated a lot and continues to over a pretty long period of

327
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:39.361
time,

328
00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:43.230
but also is not owned by any one vendor and browsers come and go and so on.

329
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.520
But one principle that's often used there as this idea of progressive

330
00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:50.640
enhancement, which maybe is of what you're pointing to there, Mark,

331
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:55.440
which is you can drop in something like if there's some fancy new audio

332
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.170
thing or some fancy new video thing,

333
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.460
or some fancy new interaction capability, you can either, first of all,

334
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:05.730
just handle the degradation case of this browser. Doesn't support that.

335
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:10.470
So let me do something simpler but in many cases, just putting in,

336
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.320
for example, those meta-tags that produce, for example,

337
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.010
a certain kind of unfurl card will just be ignored by older browsers that don't

338
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.160
know what that is. They just kind of skip over that.

339
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.210
And if you're in that situation or you just don't see that information and

340
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:26.610
probably something similar happens with yeah,

341
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:29.070
you use an older browser to load a page that has, I don't know,

342
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.880
some fancy new video thing, you just see an empty box or whatever.

343
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.640
That's not great, but it still works for you,

344
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.350
you can still get most of the content.

345
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.451
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

346
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:42.980
I think we have a lot to learn from the web in terms of how to promote sort of a

347
00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:44.960
more flexible notion of what software can be.

348
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.520
One really cool thing about the web, right,

349
00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:50.870
is that people don't have to build plugin APIs into their UIs for you to mess

350
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:54.650
with them. So if you know, a little bit of JavaScript hacking, or even,

351
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:56.630
you know, how to open the DOM inspector on a website,

352
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.280
you can go in and delete ads, you can change stuff.

353
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.130
You can install browser extensions, that modify stuff.

354
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.720
And none of that is using some official API, right?

355
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:12.350
It's just that the nature of the platform is that when you build a website sort

356
00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:16.250
of by default, there's a lot of hooks built in for people to reverse engineer,

357
00:19:16.251 --> 00:19:20.150
how it was made and to pretty intrusively modify any part of it.

358
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.200
And I think that's a really interesting goal to aspire to in more software,

359
00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:28.070
as opposed to a more traditional plugin API, like in a lot of platforms,

360
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.440
if there's no API for it, you're stuck.

361
00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:34.070
You can't customize that aspect of the software. Of course there are trade-offs,

362
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:37.010
you know, the reverse engineering approach is harder.

363
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:40.700
It tends to be less secure and it's a lot harder to maintain over time because

364
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.880
things change out from under you. But on the other hand,

365
00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:48.410
I think there's a certain beauty to being able to make changes that not only

366
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.300
did the original authors of the software not anticipate and explicitly authorize

367
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.900
you to make, but even sometimes ones that they actively don't want you to make.

368
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.450
Right? So ad blocker as being the prime example of that.

369
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.710
And so I'm very excited about the potential for browser extensions as a

370
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.010
mechanism for a more customizable kind of software,

371
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:10.880
especially as the web just seems to keep growing and growing as where all

372
00:20:10.881 --> 00:20:12.980
software is going to end up living. Yeah.

373
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.060
One of my favorite party tricks is opening the dev tools console in someone's

374
00:20:17.061 --> 00:20:20.180
browser and doing something like just changing a background color,

375
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:24.740
or some text on any website you want Facebook, cnn.com,

376
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.310
whitehouse.gov, and you know, it can blow people's minds. Wow,

377
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.313
you're an uber hacker.

378
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.770
But I actually also use that as an entry point for getting people interested in

379
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:34.461
programming,

380
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:38.270
letting them see without needing to install any new tools in their computer,

381
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.860
kind of how the web works a little bit under the hood and that they can do this

382
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.550
too. I love doing that too. If I'm trying to teach kids about HTML,

383
00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:50.620
I'll always have them vandalize their school website in the Chrome dev tools

384
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.980
inspector, and they just get such a thrill. I think it's, you know,

385
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.360
if you're brought up in this world where software seems to be this immutable

386
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.430
object that is just presented to you,

387
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.140
and then someone shows you this little trick,

388
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:05.860
you can play that all of a sudden makes it yours and something you can mess

389
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:09.400
with. I think that's just a really powerful ethos to instill in people.

390
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.690
I think Alan Kay would call it popping open the hood and seeing something

391
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:17.200
sensible inside and just a little bit of that ability to mess with the

392
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:19.990
internals, I think can go a long way. Adults too. You know,

393
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:23.770
I've shown like salespeople, how to fake a mock-up in the browser.

394
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:24.640
And I've seen people,

395
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:28.000
adults scream with delight when they realize they can do this stuff.

396
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.820
I do think there's also a problem,

397
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.650
which is that stepping from a little bit of DOM hacking in dev tools to actually

398
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:39.820
making a real browser extension is this enormous leap.

399
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.070
Like if you think about it, you know,

400
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:45.100
to publish a browser extension or even to save one for yourself,

401
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.460
you go from messing around in dev tools to, okay,

402
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.440
I'm going to learn all these weird APIs and I'm going to open up a code editor

403
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:58.300
now and I have to learn some JavaScript. And there's just this huge chasm.

404
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.560
And one of the things I'm interested in is finding ways to, I guess,

405
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:03.430
bridge that gap,

406
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.020
or just make it a smoother slope from that first hint of

407
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.330
malleability to taking further steps down that path. I think for example,

408
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:14.860
spreadsheets do this really well.

409
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.160
And this is one of my favorite things about the way spreadsheets are designed.

410
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.620
There's a lot of things that make spreadsheets magical for me,

411
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.890
but one of them is that you can take your first step of just typing in some

412
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:27.220
numbers, right? It's just a data table. There's nothing special.

413
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.190
And then you want to add together some numbers.

414
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:32.500
So you learn to use the sum function, let's say,

415
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.100
and then you just keep taking these little, little steps.

416
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.740
There's not that much learning involved with any one of them.

417
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.490
There's not that many concepts involved and fast forward two years.

418
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:46.240
And you're like running a whole business on like a bunch of V lookups, right?

419
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:50.710
And I've met so many people who don't consider themselves that technically

420
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:53.200
literate who are in fact incredibly capable in this medium.

421
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.960
And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that you can sort of

422
00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.670
accidentally end up becoming an expert because no one of those steps was too

423
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.920
big, even though it is the case that in fact,

424
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:04.750
if you add up all the little steps, you did learn a lot,

425
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.530
there was work invested, but it's a much smoother path to mastery.

426
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.030
<v 3>Yeah end user programming is something I think we're all passionate</v>

427
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.090
about here and we've written about at Ink &amp; Switch and elsewhere.

428
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.680
But this particular element of a gradual step by step,

429
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:25.360
rather than having this big jump from user of software to producer of software,

430
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:27.400
I think is a really key part of it.

431
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.120
We haven't cracked the code on that yet as an industry,

432
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.510
let's say one great discussion of this. Again,

433
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:38.380
coming back to the web is there's a YouTube talk I'll link in the show notes,

434
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.280
but essentially someone talks about how they had at first were using.

435
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:42.671
I think it was Livejournal.

436
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:46.550
They quickly learned that you can customize the background color or something by

437
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:48.860
pasting this little magic snippet of CSS.

438
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.980
And that leads you to doing more customizations.

439
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:56.210
And then you go from there to kind of going to full HTML and CSS.

440
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.130
There are some break points there. If you're going to, you know,

441
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.670
move off to your own hosting or whatever, there's a similar kind of path.

442
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:06.200
Also with HTML that are just files that you FTP to a

443
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.000
shared server or shared hosts of some kind. And then you're just writing HTML,

444
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:14.000
but you can actually break out into PHP with these little code.

445
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.120
So all of these technologies, perhaps not even purposefully,

446
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:20.840
I'm not even sure they were specifically designed to have that gradual ramp,

447
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.470
but they do, spreadsheets, HTML, PHP,

448
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:26.450
all have that kind of ramp.

449
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.800
And that ramp is how you can avoid hitting some wall where you have to have some

450
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:32.420
deep intrinsic motivation.

451
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:36.530
I want to learn to be a software engineer or manipulate computers in this way.

452
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.020
And instead you're just on the way to solving your problem.

453
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.890
You find some ways to do that by pasting some magic codes into your thing.

454
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:45.470
Maybe you get a little curious and you follow where that leads.

455
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.110
And pretty soon you're an empowered computer user.

456
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.670
<v 0>For me, this comes back to the, bring your own client thing.</v>

457
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.090
One of the most frustrating experiences for me in software is when you're in

458
00:24:55.091 --> 00:24:58.810
some sort of monolithic ecosystem and you hit a wall of something you really

459
00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:00.010
want to do, but you can't do.

460
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.820
And depending on how the ecosystem around you is arranged,

461
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.400
you might just have no choice. That's sort of it,

462
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:09.820
you can file a feedback request with the company that makes the software and

463
00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:10.810
they will tell you, you know,

464
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.450
we have put it on the backlog and good luck with that.

465
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.730
<v 3>Yeah. It's on our roadmap. Honestly,</v>

466
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:18.820
I make that answer myself in a Muse support request all the time.

467
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:19.900
And it's genuinely true,

468
00:25:19.901 --> 00:25:23.410
but I've never worked on a software project that doesn't have a roadmap,

469
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:23.891
backlog,

470
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:27.640
whatever it is that is just way longer than what you could ever hope to do in a

471
00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:28.474
lifetime.

472
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.490
<v 0>I've been on both sides of that too. Actually,</v>

473
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:34.600
a lot of how I got into this whole topic to begin with was from my experience

474
00:25:34.601 --> 00:25:36.070
being on the other side of that conversation.

475
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.380
So before starting a PhD and doing research stuff worked in startups,

476
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.040
I spent a while at an education technology company where we were building

477
00:25:45.041 --> 00:25:49.510
software for K through 12 schools. And when we started,

478
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.300
we were a very small team. I was fortunate enough to join early.

479
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.050
We were like six people living in a house together. We only had a few customers.

480
00:25:56.051 --> 00:26:00.670
And so we had the ability to focus a lot of attention on any individual request

481
00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:03.550
that came in. But as we grew over time,

482
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.760
starting to serve thousands of schools across the country,

483
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.330
it just became harder and harder to manage all this feedback.

484
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.620
And I think the default answer and what you're supposed to do given the way

485
00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:17.260
software is currently arranged is to just get better at saying no.

486
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.130
So you sort of assume, well, we're a resource constraint team.

487
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.110
We are the only ones who can change the software.

488
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.690
We don't have the time to do everything everyone wants.

489
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.850
And so we're just going to do less.

490
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.280
And I think that on the one hand that can reflect sort of a wise style of design

491
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:35.320
where you're not just building a faster horse,

492
00:26:35.321 --> 00:26:38.140
you're like digging deeper and really building something better than they could

493
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.960
have asked for. But often in my experience, it was not that at all.

494
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.670
It was just that only five people wanted something. And I agreed with them,

495
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:47.430
you know? Sure. That makes total sense for you. I can see why you want that.

496
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.600
I wish I could build it for you, but there's only five of you. And so I'm sorry.

497
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.220
And that just really, I think, was a frustrating experience for me.

498
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.130
And I found myself wondering why does my team, you know,

499
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:00.090
in this office in Boston,

500
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:04.470
have to be making these decisions for these teachers in like Idaho or whatever.

501
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.010
One of the bright spots against that sort of philosophy though,

502
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:09.480
was coming back to spreadsheets.

503
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.830
I remember this feedback call we had with a customer where we wanted to ask

504
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:16.440
them, how did you like our data reports that we're showing you?

505
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.400
Cause we were essentially building data dashboards for schools and they told us,

506
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.910
oh yeah, we don't use your data reports at all. We use spreadsheets,

507
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.690
let me show you. And so they had exported the CSV and made their own thing.

508
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.520
And on the one hand it was sort of annoying for us having spent so much of our

509
00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:34.620
time trying to build this beautiful product experience for them.

510
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.701
But on the other hand,

511
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:39.720
it was so cool to see how they had built this really weird and ugly,

512
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.900
but extremely functional spreadsheet that did exactly what they wanted for their

513
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:46.260
school and aggregated the data in a completely different way that had to do with

514
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.100
how the teams worked within their school. And I thought,

515
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:53.160
what was neat about that was that spreadsheets were this flexible toolkit that

516
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:56.010
they could use to build their own thing,

517
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.970
even something as tiny as changing a single word of copy that might've been

518
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:03.540
bothering them and causing friction in their whatever political environment in

519
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:04.374
their school.

520
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.320
There's so many tiny things that I think people would change if they could,

521
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.980
but it's just that the way software is built requires everything to funnel

522
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.620
through the original team building thing, which isn't,

523
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:14.640
he was never going to have the time.

524
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.360
And so I wish we could reorganize software to support more of that style of

525
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:19.194
customization.

526
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.190
<v 3>So we've already touched on some of your work here,</v>

527
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:27.570
Geoffrey I'll link your articles on bring your own client as well as one about

528
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.190
browser extensions being underrated.

529
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.870
But then maybe you can also talk about some of the projects you've done that

530
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.400
have to do with how you see solving this problem more broadly.

531
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.060
<v 0>On the topic of interoperability.</v>

532
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.140
One idea that I'm excited about is thinking about better ways to synchronize

533
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:49.850
across existing cloud applications. So I think there's a way in which, you know,

534
00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:51.770
if you're using one app and I'm using a different app,

535
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.210
and if we can establish a bridge between them where let's say I'm editing a doc

536
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.300
in Google docs and you're using Dropbox paper or your preferred editor,

537
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.380
and imagine every single keystroke, data is being transmitted live between them.

538
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:07.520
That starts to create this more flexible feeling where the data's not locked in

539
00:29:07.521 --> 00:29:10.490
any individual app in a more kind of lives between the apps.

540
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.470
And so one new project that I'm sort of embarking on now is trying to create

541
00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:18.320
tools that mediate, that kind of synchronization across tools.

542
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.520
Some of the hardest part comes back to that partial compatibility issue.

543
00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:24.950
We talked about earlier, where if there's changes,

544
00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:27.380
I'm making better going to mess up your experience or that aren't going to

545
00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:28.700
propagate to the app you're using.

546
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.530
How can we help users understand the relationship between these apps and feel

547
00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:37.430
comfortable with the overall user experience of stitching them together?

548
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.470
And I think this gets at some of the toughest challenges and these sort of more

549
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:44.740
flexible software ecosystems is that if we're all using the same thing,

550
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.770
it's really easy for me to know what you see and what your experience looks

551
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:49.480
like. And the more we diverge,

552
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.380
I think it's really important that I'm at least able to preserve a mental model

553
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:56.620
of maybe there's some data I'm putting in that you're not able to see for some

554
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:59.440
reason. And if I'm not aware of that, that's going to cause problems. Right?

555
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.220
And so a lot of my thinking these days is about building these sorts of sync

556
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:04.630
tools to mediate that gap.

557
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.410
<v 3>And I can think of a few examples of that,</v>

558
00:30:07.411 --> 00:30:10.530
particularly in the enterprise world, for example,

559
00:30:10.531 --> 00:30:14.520
kind of Salesforce to SQL database stuff,

560
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.950
where your sales team wants to use their CRM,

561
00:30:16.951 --> 00:30:19.460
because that's got all these tools and things that suit them.

562
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.380
They're typing stuff into a web dashboard and getting reminders about who they

563
00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:26.910
need to follow up on, but then your data team or your programmers, you know,

564
00:30:26.911 --> 00:30:29.970
they're not going to go click around in the Salesforce interface.

565
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:33.420
They need to pull stuff into a proper database like a Postgres database.

566
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.260
And so sinking seamlessly between those is valuable.

567
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.150
Do you have other concrete examples?

568
00:30:39.151 --> 00:30:41.280
You mentioned the project management tool case.

569
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.760
What are some other ones that you see as kind of like key use cases?

570
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.144
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

571
00:30:45.631 --> 00:30:49.140
It's funny sales data is one I've heard a lot about too from people and it's

572
00:30:49.141 --> 00:30:50.430
sort of a more mundane use case.

573
00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:53.400
I'm not sure I would classify it in sort of the creative tool space,

574
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.150
but I think it points to how this need just pops up a lot inside of companies.

575
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.780
<v 3>I'll go ahead and count sales as creative work actually have this discussion a</v>

576
00:31:00.781 --> 00:31:01.230
fair--

577
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.411
<v 0>Yeah, that's fair.</v>

578
00:31:01.411 --> 00:31:03.210
<v 3>Bit, which is sort of,</v>

579
00:31:03.211 --> 00:31:06.030
I like to use the term creative professional when I talk about sort of the

580
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.770
target audience for Muse,

581
00:31:07.771 --> 00:31:10.950
but also maybe just the kind of person I'm interested in serving generally.

582
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.040
And a lot of people do respond to that with, oh,

583
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:18.900
well I'm an attorney or I'm an accountant. Is that really creative work?

584
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.770
And I think it is, I think there is creativity that goes into, for example,

585
00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:26.400
financial modeling and absolutely there can be creativity that goes into sales.

586
00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:30.540
It's not traditional artist type stuff. So I would go ahead and count that.

587
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.400
<v 0>That's totally fair. And in fact,</v>

588
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.880
I think it points to why tools matter in any profession.

589
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:39.540
Like there's a reason that people want to synchronize HubSpot with MailChimp.

590
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.290
There's something going on there about what individual tools are good at in the

591
00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:45.570
entire life cycle of how you want to run your process.

592
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.340
And the need for sync emerges from the reality that no one tool can do

593
00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:53.130
everything perfectly. And so I think that's totally valid.

594
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.160
<v 3>I'm reminded of the phrase toolmaker humility,</v>

595
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.300
which came up in our podcast with Balint, from Craft,

596
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.020
where he really tries to keep that in his heart,

597
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:08.460
as he designs the product is knowing you're not only not the only tool that

598
00:32:08.461 --> 00:32:13.380
people are using, but you're probably a large collection of both process.

599
00:32:13.381 --> 00:32:15.900
And over time your toolkit is changing and that sort of thing.

600
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:19.860
And I just feel it's so easy for toolmakers to want to make the everything tool.

601
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.551
Don't worry,

602
00:32:20.551 --> 00:32:23.340
we'll just do everything and you can put everything in here and we'll be all in

603
00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.770
one place and then it can all work together seamlessly.

604
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.710
And that has never been how the world has worked.

605
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.110
It has never going to be how the world works.

606
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.280
And if you can design your tool to play as well as possible and be aware of that

607
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.590
reality, I think everyone's better off.

608
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.200
<v 0>I think it's tricky though,</v>

609
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.830
because you need not only the willingness of the toolmakers to play with other

610
00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:43.490
tools,

611
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:47.210
but you need a platform that supports that interoperability in the right way.

612
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.300
So I think Craft is the perfect specific example of this.

613
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.900
I think they've done the best possible thing you could expect a writing tool to

614
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:57.500
do today, which is that I think as Balint mentioned on this podcast,

615
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.350
they let you save your documents either to their cloud,

616
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.070
which gives you real-time collaboration. You can comment and things like that,

617
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.950
or you can save it to a file, which gives you more control.

618
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.740
It is sort of locally stored with you.

619
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:11.990
You have the ability to save it wherever you want.

620
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:14.900
Other people can potentially open those files in different applications,

621
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:17.000
I think is a ultimate goal of that team's,

622
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.070
but it's an either or so if you want to collaborate in real time and have that

623
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:25.100
flexibility to open those files and other applications,

624
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.970
there's no technological solution to that today that exists.

625
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.710
There's no platform that team can build on to support that. And to me,

626
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:37.580
that's the key missing piece. There's this ecosystem missing there.

627
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.260
That means that even in this dream world where Google decides they want third

628
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:46.370
party editors to exist for Google docs or something supporting that technically

629
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.270
is very challenging.

630
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.660
And so I think we need better platform support for that kind of thing.

631
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.770
In addition to thinking about business incentives for people to even want to do

632
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:55.101
in the first place.

633
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:58.240
<v 2>Yeah. This is a great example to bring up. I agree.</v>

634
00:33:58.241 --> 00:34:01.540
There's a huge technical challenge here.

635
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:04.630
It's one that I and many people around Muse and the Ink &amp; Switch research lab

636
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.850
had been working on for some years now. Yeah.

637
00:34:06.851 --> 00:34:11.200
So you would need to have that in play something like files for the real time

638
00:34:11.201 --> 00:34:14.980
collaborative internet, what is that abstraction? And then on top of that,

639
00:34:14.981 --> 00:34:19.660
you do have this whole issue of business and incentives and dynamics

640
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.490
and path dependence,

641
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.740
because let's say conservatively that creating this technology takes 10

642
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.710
engineer years, several million dollars. Who's going to put that up.

643
00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:34.060
And then how do you actually turn that into a public platform that's optimized

644
00:34:34.061 --> 00:34:36.160
for the benefit of all the individual users and not the creator.

645
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:37.300
It's tough problem.

646
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.120
One of the things that I liked about this project that you mentioned where

647
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:43.300
you're synchronizing data between cloud services,

648
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.680
is that it does grapple with the reality of here's our initial condition of

649
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.710
there are a bunch of proprietary cloud services that do have important data,

650
00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.830
and it'd be ideal if they had a perfect JSON API,

651
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:55.180
but that's not the reality that we live in.

652
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.510
So we need to find a way to help our users get data back and forth between them.

653
00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.560
I feel like a lot of the conversations in this space that is a space of open

654
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:07.420
systems are of the form we should X where X is design and

655
00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:11.230
build and use a perfect open system. That's not going to happen. In fact,

656
00:35:11.231 --> 00:35:14.530
it's unreasonable for you to ask other people dedicate their mortal lives to

657
00:35:14.531 --> 00:35:15.580
your pet projects, right?

658
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.790
You need to find a way to grapple with these dynamics and get out there in

659
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:18.791
reality.

660
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.920
<v 0>Yeah, this is a tension,</v>

661
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:24.430
I think a lot about between sort of an incremental approach versus a first

662
00:35:24.431 --> 00:35:28.270
principles approach. I think you could frame it for example, the Solid project,

663
00:35:28.271 --> 00:35:29.650
which is led by Tim Berners Lee,

664
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.010
and is pretty prominent in this space is one attempt where their ideas,

665
00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:33.400
you know,

666
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.910
we're going to essentially fundamentally rearchitect how web apps are built.

667
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.700
We're going to give users these little,

668
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.050
they call them pods where the users control their own data and then web

669
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:46.560
applications can connect to your pod to access and edit your data.

670
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.110
But the applications themselves don't store the data.

671
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.630
And I think that's a lovely vision.

672
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.830
I would love to see something like that succeed. But as you're saying, Mark,

673
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.910
I think the biggest challenge is how are we possibly going to get from the world

674
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:01.560
we have today to that future?

675
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.510
Are we really going to rebuild the web stack from scratch?

676
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.400
And is the experience going to be better enough for both developers and users

677
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.440
to incentivize such a massive shift?

678
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

679
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.350
<v 0>I tend to think that no amount of, you know,</v>

680
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.400
legislation or regulation let's say is going to successfully push us to a

681
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.910
solution if it's not better for both developers and users.

682
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:28.530
And so I think we need to think about making it incredibly easy and awesome

683
00:36:28.531 --> 00:36:32.820
for both of those groups in order to get from where we are today to that

684
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.750
beautiful future.

685
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.660
<v 2>Yeah and to be clear,</v>

686
00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:39.620
I do believe it's possible to get to a future that looks very different from the

687
00:36:39.621 --> 00:36:41.180
present a radically different future,

688
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.970
but necessarily you are going to get there in incremental steps,

689
00:36:43.971 --> 00:36:47.240
which might be incremental steps from the status quo or incremental steps from

690
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.961
zilch,

691
00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:51.020
basically where you're building up a new system in the context of the current

692
00:36:51.021 --> 00:36:53.630
ecosystem. I think both those are viable. I agree.

693
00:36:53.631 --> 00:36:55.910
I think what we need here is entrepreneurs in the broadest sense,

694
00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:57.050
not just of commercial ventures,

695
00:36:57.051 --> 00:37:02.030
but of ideas and nonprofits and politics and all of these things to really

696
00:37:02.031 --> 00:37:03.380
work towards the future that they want to see.

697
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.790
<v 0>I think another really important thing on the entrepreneurship theme there</v>

698
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.640
is being realistic about use cases.

699
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.050
I think my favorite startup style thinkers are the people who can really focus

700
00:37:15.051 --> 00:37:19.280
on what is this technology actually useful for and how can we focus in on that

701
00:37:19.281 --> 00:37:20.114
one killer app?

702
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.140
And I'm not sure that we've necessarily found that killer app yet in this space.

703
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.080
For me, I think collaborative writing might be the one personally,

704
00:37:27.081 --> 00:37:29.810
but I worry that you can make all the tech demos you want,

705
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.690
but a lot of things take off in a particular niche.

706
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:37.730
And I'm interested in finding where's the place where people desperately are

707
00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:41.630
needing this real-time interoperability to the point that they would actually

708
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.040
abandon their familiar tools.

709
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.544
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

710
00:37:43.911 --> 00:37:46.550
I feel like this actually afflicts quite a few projects in this space where

711
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:47.271
again,

712
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:50.390
they're thinking in terms of generalities and they don't have a specific use

713
00:37:50.391 --> 00:37:53.030
case in mind. I actually called this the Mark rule for product management,

714
00:37:53.031 --> 00:37:56.540
which is you need to have a single named human being,

715
00:37:56.541 --> 00:37:58.670
quite an email who specifically wants your project.

716
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.520
And that sounds like a low bar,

717
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.250
but in a lot of cases you ask people that and they're like, oh,

718
00:38:04.251 --> 00:38:07.550
it's salespeople. Well, do you have a specific one in mind that I can email?

719
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.490
Well, not always. Right. So it's a good baseline.

720
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.660
<v 0>Yeah. I think often, especially with this kind of customizable software,</v>

721
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:19.640
it's tempting to get into, wouldn't it be cool if conversations that,

722
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.980
where it might be nice, but there's no real pain.

723
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.670
One use case that I think is really compelling to me is I read a paper recently

724
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:29.960
by some researchers at Northwestern university on accessibility issues and

725
00:38:29.961 --> 00:38:30.794
collaborative writing.

726
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.920
And they talk about how people with sight impairments have a really hard time

727
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:37.540
using Google docs with our teammates,

728
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.740
because there are certain accessibility issues around how that platform works.

729
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:46.750
And what they often end up doing is they'll either convince their team to adopt

730
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:49.930
a different workflow, or they'll just give up and copy paste,

731
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.530
text out into a word doc or something edit it there and then paste it back.

732
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.550
And it's very, very cumbersome. It's not just a little inconvenience.

733
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.400
It really limits their ability to be a true member of their team.

734
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:04.300
And they have to make this incredibly uncomfortable choice where they talk about

735
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.440
the social anxiety around trying to convince all of their coworkers to use a

736
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:09.274
different tool,

737
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:14.410
or just internalizing that friction and deciding to try to live

738
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:17.740
with it. And I think that if you imagine a world of greater interoperability,

739
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.690
could we have a text editor that is much more optimized for this specific group

740
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:26.320
of people who have very different needs and still allow them to collaborate with

741
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:29.530
their peers more effectively? The more that people's needs differ,

742
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.180
especially people with disabilities,

743
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:34.690
I think often have fairly different kinds of needs. And a lot of other people,

744
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.670
I think that those are use cases.

745
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:40.210
I'm thinking a lot about in terms of where we really need better inter-

746
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:40.810
operability.

747
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.180
<v 2>Yeah it's a great motivating factor.</v>

748
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.280
It's easy to think of the what-ifs in terms of cool conveniences and emojis and

749
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:50.320
so on, but let's not forget about that as well.

750
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.800
<v 0>I also think as an antidote to cool conveniences,</v>

751
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.510
there's sort of a interesting paradoxical way that software customization

752
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.450
actually promotes very boring stability.

753
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.820
So I think one of the special things about let's say programmers and their text

754
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.181
editors,

755
00:40:07.181 --> 00:40:10.870
which is a place where we have some of this file based interoperability is that

756
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:11.830
if you talk to programmers,

757
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.940
often they've invested like a decade plus in using a particular editor, right.

758
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.770
And they've carried it with them from job to job.

759
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.030
They've really made it their own.

760
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.370
And they have successfully been able to avoid switching tools because

761
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:25.240
of interoperability.

762
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.560
It's not this kind of tinkering trying a bunch of new things, mindset.

763
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:33.730
It's exactly the opposite of just getting to invest deeply in one tool and to

764
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.564
keep using it.

765
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.580
I think that's an underrated benefit of interoperability is just

766
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.800
yeah. Being able to make that deep investment.

767
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.184
<v 3>The</v>

768
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.550
revealed preferences of software engineers is that yeah,

769
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.830
very standardized file formats,

770
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:54.150
usually plain text wide variety of source editors,

771
00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:58.230
wide variety of different kinds of plugins and linters and things like that.

772
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.060
I guess you do have to agree on your version control system that needs to be at

773
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:06.720
least somewhat standardized on your team, terminal,

774
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:11.070
even things like database clients, you know, SQL is pretty standardized.

775
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.500
So software engineers seem to prefer software that changes less and

776
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:20.460
has more interoperability. And it does have the problem of,

777
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.750
as we've mentioned previously,

778
00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:26.040
with email or Twitter as a platform versus a product. Yeah, it is hard.

779
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.120
Someone says, you know,

780
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.760
programming editors or source code would be really great.

781
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:30.990
If you could drop in an image,

782
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.640
I can put it in a little diagram of my architecture or something like that in a

783
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:38.240
comment that would make perfect sense. I think that would be a big improvement,

784
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:40.760
but that would be very hard to do because of the plain text format.

785
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:44.210
We've all been using a very long time and all the tools are built around that,

786
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:48.860
but essentially software engineers prefer that versus something sort of newer

787
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.330
and shinier and with more features.

788
00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:51.731
<v 2>Yeah. And in fact,</v>

789
00:41:51.731 --> 00:41:56.500
it's the ecosystem that is extraordinarily susceptible to customization and

790
00:41:56.501 --> 00:41:59.500
extension because all the participants are able and in fact,

791
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:02.590
inclined to do that. So kind of competitively,

792
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.990
it's very hard to win without leveraging that.

793
00:42:04.991 --> 00:42:08.380
I think a good example of that is the editor wars, which to my mind,

794
00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:12.370
are now kind of coming to a close and VS Code has won to a large extent,

795
00:42:12.371 --> 00:42:16.210
I think because of the incredible platformization they have with extensions and

796
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.410
language servers and so forth.

797
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.660
And to be clear there's going to be a bunch of editors. I use a different one,

798
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:24.370
but they've been able to really pull ahead while accelerating the whole

799
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.790
ecosystem for developers because they lean so heavily into the open platform

800
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:27.791
angle.

801
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:32.230
<v 0>I also think though that the diversity of text editors can teach us something</v>

802
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:36.340
about how to reconcile this partial compatibility thing we were talking about,

803
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:38.260
because if you think about it, yes,

804
00:42:38.261 --> 00:42:42.100
the base format of the code being shared between people can be really stripped

805
00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:43.120
down into this text format.

806
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.540
But some editors like VS Code do a lot with that format.

807
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:50.980
They'll run fancy analyses on top of it and do syntax highlighting and all these

808
00:42:50.981 --> 00:42:55.450
like auto-complete things which are not inherently part of the data exchange

809
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:55.840
format.

810
00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.050
They're just bells and whistles that each individual editor gets to add on top

811
00:42:59.051 --> 00:43:01.660
to that experience. But I'm not forced to opt into that.

812
00:43:01.661 --> 00:43:02.494
I can use a stripped-down,

813
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.250
I could use Microsoft notepad to edit code if I wanted to. Right.

814
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.020
There's nothing stopping me from doing that.

815
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.670
<v 3>And that is the standard text editor.</v>

816
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.460
<v 0>Yeah. In fact, I think when I was like 12 years old,</v>

817
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.610
that's probably when I started using to write code because I didn't know any

818
00:43:15.611 --> 00:43:15.851
better.

819
00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:20.320
And I think that's an interesting for me lesson to reflect on is can we get more

820
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:24.850
places where there's this shared core and then more functionality built up as

821
00:43:24.851 --> 00:43:27.100
optional apps, specific extensions.

822
00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.300
<v 3>And then we touched briefly on, I guess, financial incentives.</v>

823
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.720
And we look at the interoperability problem writ large.

824
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.550
Certainly it comes from the world of files kind of classic desktop files.

825
00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:42.520
And yeah, there was problems with sort of format, openness,

826
00:43:42.521 --> 00:43:45.160
like Word docs files, for example,

827
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.640
but ultimately files didn't seem to have a lot of that agency and

828
00:43:48.641 --> 00:43:49.480
interoperability.

829
00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:54.460
And it's really both mobile and cloud that I think brought us these more closed

830
00:43:54.461 --> 00:43:58.600
up hermetically sealed systems, both for their own reasons. I think mobile,

831
00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.890
it was more around kind of safety and security and comprehensibility to end

832
00:44:02.891 --> 00:44:05.110
users, particularly very non-technical users.

833
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.460
But on the maybe cloud web app side, particularly B2B software.

834
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:14.500
Now you get into this thing where data is considered to be where the

835
00:44:14.501 --> 00:44:18.640
value is. James Chan use this terminology data swamp,

836
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.390
and that's kind of like the aggregating a bunch of data together.

837
00:44:22.391 --> 00:44:24.160
And that's where the value is.

838
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.220
And you even see that in what people expect to pay for software.

839
00:44:27.221 --> 00:44:29.200
We run up against that with Muse.

840
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.040
We talked to Balint from Craft about that as well,

841
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:34.560
which is people are in the mindset of, oh,

842
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.330
if you're going to host my data for me,

843
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.860
then you need to run a server or whatever.

844
00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:41.460
Then I can justify paying a subscription. But if I'm quote unquote,

845
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.350
just buying the software,

846
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.710
they feel like software isn't valuable on its own.

847
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.370
And of course that's really restrictive for making truly great software.

848
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:52.590
And furthermore, it creates all these incentives around.

849
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:54.360
Of course you want to lock up the data. Of course,

850
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:57.270
something like a two way sync, like you described,

851
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.000
that's hurting my business's value.

852
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:04.980
So trying to find a way to create financial incentives

853
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.930
and paying for the software and the value that that provides you versus the

854
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:12.300
data, the data swamp. That's a tough one.

855
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.730
<v 2>Yeah. It's tough.</v>

856
00:45:13.731 --> 00:45:17.510
One angle that I like circling back to our previous podcast on

857
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:22.730
games is so to kind of recap the dynamic there is that there are some

858
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.500
ecosystems that are so high powered because of their open

859
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.930
platformized scriptable customizable,

860
00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:34.790
whatever nature that no amount of proprietary excellence

861
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:35.743
can compete.

862
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.470
And I don't think we've quite found or charted that path in the world of

863
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.900
creative tools. And you think about, I don't know,

864
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:46.940
Photoshop could an open Photoshop be so much better as such that it displaces

865
00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.750
Adobe Photoshop. I mean, maybe right. I don't yet see the path for that,

866
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.820
but perhaps in the world of multi devices or multi users or other use cases

867
00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.060
there is. So I think that's one promising angle. There are other angles,

868
00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:01.130
but that's me seems perhaps the most interesting.

869
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.190
<v 3>That's an interesting one to think of the way that, for example,</v>

870
00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:08.810
the web and its open standards and interoperability displaced,

871
00:46:08.811 --> 00:46:13.400
and was clearly a huge improvement on the more closed up formats like flash

872
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:18.050
or maybe Java servlets that came before clearly the web was just so

873
00:46:18.051 --> 00:46:22.550
much superior. In addition to being open hackable,

874
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.030
you can pop up in your DOM inspector and do stuff to any webpage.

875
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:30.320
So what would be an equivalent of that that would make Photoshop or even

876
00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:33.680
something, a beloved current piece of software like Sketch or Figma,

877
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.730
what would make those things feel like a Java servlet by comparison?

878
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.770
<v 0>I think there is a really tricky balance here to strike because it is very</v>

879
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:46.790
valuable to have someone think through an entire unified product experience and

880
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:48.500
make it all fit together in a coherent way.

881
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.340
I know this is something you've thought about a lot with when I use Muse,

882
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.440
it feels like someone has taken care to design this whole environment.

883
00:46:54.441 --> 00:46:58.670
And I don't have to do much work to sort of put together a bunch of pieces and

884
00:46:59.090 --> 00:46:59.930
90% of people,

885
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:03.830
most of the time don't want to like assemble their own software from scratch.

886
00:47:03.831 --> 00:47:07.400
Right? There's a reason we pay designers to think through these problems for us.

887
00:47:07.401 --> 00:47:11.270
And I think that's totally a good thing and designers bring a lot of value in

888
00:47:11.271 --> 00:47:15.320
that way. But at the same time, I think that we can think about,

889
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.670
rather than giving someone this hermetically sealed box, can we use an analogy,

890
00:47:19.671 --> 00:47:23.120
like build a beautiful Lego set for them and hand it to them where if they like

891
00:47:23.121 --> 00:47:26.120
it just as this that's fine. And if they want to add one Lego right there,

892
00:47:26.121 --> 00:47:29.560
it's not a big deal. They sort of see the composition of how this thing made.

893
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.590
They have a little bit of flexibility to tweak it because it's made out of

894
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:33.670
parts. They understand,

895
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:38.260
I think that's a design ethos that sometimes I feel like we're in danger of

896
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.900
moving away from there's this great story.

897
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.060
And one of my favorite books about end-user programming,

898
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:45.790
which is called changing minds by Andy diSessa,

899
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.240
who's sort of a education and computing researcher.

900
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.800
And he talks about this nightmare he had where he's riding a bike and he looks

901
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:56.830
down at the gears and they are labeled not with numbers,

902
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:01.360
but with words like this is gravel mode, this is like uphill mode.

903
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.540
And he has no idea how to use the thing. You know,

904
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.660
if I'm going downhill on gravel, do I use gravel mode or downhill mode?

905
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.070
And he talks about how like,

906
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.740
because we're used to riding bikes with numbered gears,

907
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:12.700
this sounds sort of ridiculous,

908
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.940
but you can imagine the product manager that had that conversation,

909
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:18.430
where they said these numbers make no sense to people.

910
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:21.640
People don't want to like, see 1, 2, 3, 4, they want to understand the function.

911
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.090
We need to give them an easier way to understand what this tool is for.

912
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.350
But what you're robbing them of is a structural sense of what's going on

913
00:48:29.351 --> 00:48:31.300
underneath to provide that functionality.

914
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.950
So that the moment you go off the expected use cases for the thing,

915
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.610
you have nothing to lean on, you have no coherent understanding of the system.

916
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.830
And so everything just falls apart.

917
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.090
And what he contends is that people can actually learn sometimes more than I

918
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:50.140
think we give them credit for like, it's not actually that hard to learn a bike.

919
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.400
Everyone learns how to ride a bike,

920
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.550
even though it takes some practice and you have to feel out the gears to

921
00:48:54.551 --> 00:48:55.420
understand how they work.

922
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:58.840
Once you've put in that little bit of effort you have this sort of generalizable

923
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:02.710
understanding of the system that can go a long way and is much more generically

924
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:03.544
applicable.

925
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.120
And so I think it'd be nice to see a little bit more of that style reflected in

926
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:08.110
how we build software for people.

927
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:09.930
<v 3>Well said.</v>

928
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.670
Yeah I think the design ethos often is kind of polarized towards the

929
00:49:14.671 --> 00:49:18.120
edges, which are either making pure consumer stuff. And just,

930
00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:21.270
just to be as simple as possible, no choices,

931
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:26.280
no customization just can't have no chance of going off the rails and getting

932
00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:29.130
confused. Or we have the full-on,

933
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:33.720
I'm going to build my own PC from parts and put together my own Linux

934
00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:38.430
distribution and assemble my Raspberry Pi and put together all my special

935
00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:42.510
VS Code plugins. And there's kind of nothing in between. Sometimes.

936
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.010
<v 2>This reminds me of an important point about these platforms and ecosystems.</v>

937
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.440
If you look at the successful spaces,

938
00:49:49.441 --> 00:49:53.460
whether it's software or protocols or hardware.

939
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.050
It generally is not--

940
00:49:55.110 --> 00:50:00.060
You have some platform and then a bunch of individual users completely

941
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.290
customizing their setup. What tends to happen is you have the platform,

942
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.360
you have a small number of secondary market providers. If you will,

943
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.080
who provide modules, extensions implements, what have you.

944
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:15.720
And a much bigger group that tries by the way,

945
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:18.900
but a lot of that stuff just kind of gets filtered out. Doesn't bump up the top,

946
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.460
but if you create an opportunity for people to have a business or some other

947
00:50:23.461 --> 00:50:26.910
sense of fulfillment from providing these things to the community,

948
00:50:26.911 --> 00:50:30.260
you only need a few of them to really enhance the ecosystem. And yes,

949
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:32.630
you're going to have some users who want to build their whole tractor from

950
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:36.380
scratch or who want to go in and fiddle with the HTML and CSS. That's fine,

951
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.030
but often the real meat and potatoes of these ecosystems is the secondary market

952
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:43.130
of service module, extension providers,

953
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.530
and the somewhat sad consequences of that as someone who's really into end user

954
00:50:48.531 --> 00:50:53.240
programming is that often it's not the end user programming experience that

955
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:54.860
matters the most.

956
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.990
If you look at how hard it often is to build a module or extension or an

957
00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:01.850
add-on often it's frankly, a huge pain,

958
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.200
but people who are doing that as a small business, as a major hobby,

959
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.730
they're willing to get over that.

960
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:10.520
And then they can provide the service for all the other users in the ecosystem.

961
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.430
So it often ends up being important is distribution,

962
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.960
obviously platform access and some ability to monetize or get the

963
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:19.370
equivalent personal fulfillment.

964
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.990
<v 0>I'm not sure. I totally agree that it's sad for end user programming.</v>

965
00:51:22.991 --> 00:51:25.990
I think you're totally right that there's this collaborative dynamic,

966
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.981
but for me,

967
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:30.670
that's sort of just one part of the picture to keep in mind when we're designing

968
00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:32.260
tools for this. So like for example,

969
00:51:32.261 --> 00:51:36.220
and I think there's a similar dynamic in spreadsheet usage where there's been

970
00:51:36.221 --> 00:51:37.540
some great studies by Bonnie Nardi,

971
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.570
who's kind of like a hero in the end-user programming community of how

972
00:51:40.571 --> 00:51:42.550
spreadsheets are used in offices.

973
00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.270
And what it turns out being is that there's like someone in the office who's

974
00:51:46.271 --> 00:51:47.560
like the spreadsheet person, right?

975
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.140
And when you have a really complicated formula, to write,

976
00:51:50.141 --> 00:51:52.300
you go to them and they help you and they figure it out.

977
00:51:52.301 --> 00:51:53.950
And then you go back to your desk and keep working on it.

978
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:57.850
But the key thing there is that there is a large part of that ecosystem that is

979
00:51:57.851 --> 00:52:01.450
available to you even as a novice. And you don't have to like, again,

980
00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:04.210
ask someone to ship you a hermetically sealed thing.

981
00:52:04.211 --> 00:52:07.450
Maybe you can sort of read the formula they wrote and start to learn a bit.

982
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:11.380
And so I think having fuzzier boundaries of expertise and enabling more

983
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:13.870
collaboration is a thing to strive for.

984
00:52:13.871 --> 00:52:18.100
One project I've worked on that sort of embodies this goal a bit is this project

985
00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:18.934
called wildcard,

986
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:22.270
which is a toolkit for people to build their own browser extensions without

987
00:52:22.271 --> 00:52:25.840
programming. And the rough idea there is like you were saying, mark,

988
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.520
it's pretty hard to build a browser extension.

989
00:52:27.521 --> 00:52:31.360
Some browser extensions are extremely complicated. And when I install them,

990
00:52:31.361 --> 00:52:32.680
I have no idea how they work inside.

991
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.750
If I want to tweak the extension or maybe compose two extensions in a new way,

992
00:52:37.751 --> 00:52:39.520
that's typically really hard to do.

993
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.790
And the thesis of the wildcard project is that yes,

994
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:45.370
some extensions need to be really complicated, like you said,

995
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.850
but also there some extensions that I think don't need to be that complicated.

996
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:52.510
I remember using for a while an extension that added a checkbox next to every

997
00:52:52.511 --> 00:52:53.830
transaction on a bank statement.

998
00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.590
So you can just remember whether you'd already written it down somewhere else.

999
00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.070
And this had like thousands of installs on the Chrome extension store. You know,

1000
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.040
that's not as sophisticated thing, but again,

1001
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.670
it's really hard to even build something that simple as a non programmer.

1002
00:53:06.671 --> 00:53:10.240
So the goal of wildcard is can we take that subset of extensions,

1003
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:15.190
which is not that complicated and make it accessible to normal people to build.

1004
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.670
And actually, as you can tell, you know, I'm sort of a spreadsheets fan.

1005
00:53:18.671 --> 00:53:20.620
And so the paradigm we went with was,

1006
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.820
what if you could edit a website in a spreadsheet is the vision, you know,

1007
00:53:24.821 --> 00:53:25.740
you up a little pain,

1008
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:29.160
you see some data and a table that's sort of represents what's in the page,

1009
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:30.240
like on a new site,

1010
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.870
it might be a list of articles with their names and authors and whatever.

1011
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.510
And then as you mess with the spreadsheet,

1012
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.890
whether that's sorting and filtering or adding new columns with little formulas

1013
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:43.800
in them, all of that flows back into the page and modifies it.

1014
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:47.580
And the goal there is that if you've used a spreadsheet,

1015
00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:49.950
you can maybe learn your way around this environment.

1016
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:51.810
You don't need to like open a code editor.

1017
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.840
You're just right there in the website and you can build and share these

1018
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:57.540
customizations with other people. Now, again,

1019
00:53:57.541 --> 00:53:59.850
it might be the case that 90% of users of this thing,

1020
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.610
eventually we'll just install pre-made things and others made.

1021
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.220
But if they're not written in JavaScript,

1022
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:07.890
if they're in this sort of more user-friendly paradigm,

1023
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.700
maybe more people will end up popping the hood there and making little tweaks of

1024
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:14.070
their own. So I think it's this delicate balance there.

1025
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.330
<v 3>Well, before we go,</v>

1026
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:21.490
one question I think that can come up sometimes is this question of designing

1027
00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:22.900
software for other people.

1028
00:54:22.901 --> 00:54:27.100
And maybe you can imagine that product designers who their whole role in fact is

1029
00:54:27.101 --> 00:54:32.020
doing that and software as this abstract, hard to understand thing,

1030
00:54:32.021 --> 00:54:36.190
you actually need another person with that expertise to design it for you,

1031
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.130
but you could actually swing back the other way as well and say,

1032
00:54:39.131 --> 00:54:42.010
how can anyone else know your deeds? And in fact,

1033
00:54:42.011 --> 00:54:45.300
this is why some of the startup advice is solve your own problem,

1034
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:49.480
build something for yourself because you know it in an intimate way that no one

1035
00:54:49.481 --> 00:54:53.290
else can, where do you stand on this? How can others design software?

1036
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.510
<v 0>Yeah, this may be a slightly extreme way to put it,</v>

1037
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:01.740
but I think I'm pretty pessimistic that it's possible to design truly great

1038
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:03.840
software for someone besides yourself.

1039
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.470
Especially if the person you're designing for is operating in a complex

1040
00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:09.060
environment. Like for example,

1041
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:12.120
I had experienced designing for teachers and I've never been a teacher in a

1042
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:15.660
classroom before. And I felt like, no matter how many user interviews I did,

1043
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.710
there was nothing that could possibly replace a decade of teaching experience

1044
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:22.950
and sort of the depth of understanding there. And I'm sure, you know,

1045
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:25.800
I could have done better at user interviews or whatever, but that's sort of,

1046
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.340
I think an initial hypothesis, then the question is, what do we take from that?

1047
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.180
Well,

1048
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.360
in some ways that sounds really disappointing because you might say what that

1049
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:35.610
means is that you're going to end up with a bunch of 22 year olds in San

1050
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:37.080
Francisco building food delivery apps,

1051
00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.660
because those are the people making the software. Right.

1052
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.470
But I think there's kind of a fun way to flip it, which is to say, well,

1053
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.230
maybe that just means we need more people to be able to build software.

1054
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.910
And you might say, well,

1055
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:52.020
I don't know if let's say teachers can build software if they're interested in

1056
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:55.320
that. But I think that if we had more democratized tools,

1057
00:55:55.321 --> 00:55:57.180
you can imagine that whatever it is,

1058
00:55:57.181 --> 00:56:02.100
10% of teachers who have an interest in this stuff who have some sensibilities

1059
00:56:02.101 --> 00:56:02.934
around design,

1060
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.900
if we had more tools to help them build their own tools and maybe build tools

1061
00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:07.734
for other teachers,

1062
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:13.050
I think you could imagine a world where we have much more sort of insightful

1063
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:17.340
software that draws on the experience of being the user and a larger variety of

1064
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:20.160
domains. That's not just programmers scratching their own itch.

1065
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.880
<v 3>That almost brings a moral argument to end</v>

1066
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.500
user programming. That it's not just,

1067
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:31.120
this is something that we as technology people think would be cool or

1068
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.620
fun or exciting,

1069
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.780
but in fact is something needed to bring this really important medium this

1070
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:41.200
21st century medium of software to the wider world.

1071
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:44.800
And that's all the different professions that could need it. Young people,

1072
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:48.310
old people, people in different places and different cultures.

1073
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.880
The only way that everyone will really get the software and the computer

1074
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:56.560
experiences they deserve is to make programming more accessible,

1075
00:56:56.561 --> 00:56:58.210
not to every single person in the world,

1076
00:56:58.211 --> 00:57:02.200
but to enough that we can represent all of those different people in the

1077
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.034
software world.

1078
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:07.500
<v 0>Yeah. And I think an important thing there is keeping an open mind about how our</v>

1079
00:57:07.501 --> 00:57:09.330
culture could change. You know,

1080
00:57:09.331 --> 00:57:12.210
people throw around the idea of computational literacy,

1081
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:13.830
a fair amount and the tools for thought community.

1082
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:18.480
And I think one of the lessons to learn from literacy is that it took a while to

1083
00:57:18.481 --> 00:57:20.250
get to the point where everyone could read and write.

1084
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:24.240
And maybe before mass literacy, it would have sounded reasonable to say,

1085
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.810
why does this farmer even need that they don't care about reading and writing?

1086
00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:28.740
It's not important to them,

1087
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:33.330
but we ended up creating a new society where that was part of how people

1088
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.283
operated.

1089
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.640
And I think that you could make a similar argument for building software where,

1090
00:57:38.641 --> 00:57:39.030
you know,

1091
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:42.900
just because people genuinely don't think they need to do this today or don't

1092
00:57:42.901 --> 00:57:44.070
care about it, or don't want to,

1093
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:48.330
that's not a reflection of the way society will always be. I think we can,

1094
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.010
in an optimistic sense,

1095
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.010
imagine sort of a feedback loop where if we change our tools,

1096
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.780
eventually society will catch up.

1097
00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.720
<v 3>I think that's the perfect note to wrap it up.</v>

1098
00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.790
Thanks everyone for listening.
